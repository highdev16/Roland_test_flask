# Test Backend (Flask)

This project is supposed to be run on AppEngine.
But because GCP doesn't support China in the list, I couldn't make my own account on it.
So this project should be run on localhost.

- Running commands (Assumed you install python 3)

pip3 install -U Flask
pip3 install -U firebase_admin
flask run --host=192.168.1.119
